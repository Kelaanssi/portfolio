      <h3>Late Christmas</h3>
      <p>My first ever videogame project was a 2D platformer game in Unity. You play as Santa Claus, and the game's idea is to deliver either as many presents as you can in 60 seconds, or deliver the required amount of presents as fast as possible.</p>

      <h3>Gun Guy Zombies</h3>
      <p>My second videogame was a group project with three people, a 3D spin-off of Gun Guy, which was a 2D-game of another group member. Starting out as a horror game, it consists of going through a forest, completing tasks while avoiding zombies. At the end, you reach a shack, where you find a gun, and start killing the zombies.</p>

      <h3>Arctic Playground</h3>
      <p>My third videogame was another group project, a VR sandbox game showcased in Vectorama, which is a yearly online gaming event in Finland. The game consists of playing around with snow in an open area, allowing you to grab snowballs from the ground, throw them at targets, build a snowman and decorate it, form snow cubes and build with them.</p>
